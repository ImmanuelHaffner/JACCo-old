Put your tests into resource/<your-name>/.

For all tests you have to put a .c-file in there.
For lexer-tests also put a .tok-file in there.
.tok-files look like this:

---------------------------------------
0
exercise.c:1:1 constant 42
exercise.c:1:5 keyword if
exercise.c:2:2 string-literal "bla\n"
exercise.c:2:9 identifier x
exercise.c:2:10 punctuator +
---------------------------------------

The first line specifies the expected return code of your compiler. The 
following lines give the expected tokens.
